# Sweep AI turns bugs & feature requests into code changes (https://sweep.dev)
# For details on our config file, check out our docs at https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/config

# This setting contains a list of rules that Sweep will check for. If any of these rules are broken in a new commit, Sweep will create an pull request to fix the broken rule.
rules:
  - "All docstrings and comments should be up to date."
  - "Each section should be 1000 to 2000 words. Do not be stingy with your words. Don't add any formatting or headers. Just write the copy of the section."
  - "Do not use clich√©s such as "as we delve" and the like. Be more creative, professional, and dynamic. Use more interesting turns of phrase, distinctive words, or just leave them out all together."
  - "Keep all your messages short and simple. The more concise the better."
  - "Render the input as a distilled list of succinct statements, assertions, associations, concepts, analogies, and metaphors. The idea is to capture as much, conceptually, as possible but with as few words as possible. Write it in a way that makes sense to you, as the future audience will be another language model, not a human."
  - "You will translate slide deck text into a stock image description that would suit the slide. The image description should be specific, precise, and definitive. Keep the description to two or three sentences, and do not add any dressing or formatting. Just the description and nothing else."

# This is the branch that Sweep will develop from and make pull requests to. Most people use 'main' or 'master' but some users also use 'dev' or 'staging'.
branch: 'main'

# By default Sweep will read the logs and outputs from your existing Github Actions. To disable this, set this to false.
gha_enabled: True

# This is the description of your project. It will be used by sweep when creating PRs. You can tell Sweep what's unique about your project, what frameworks you use, or anything else you want.
#
# Example:
#
# description: sweepai/sweep is a python project. The main api endpoints are in sweepai/api.py. Write code that adheres to PEP8.

# This sets whether to create pull requests as drafts. If this is set to True, then all pull requests will be created as drafts and GitHub Actions will not be triggered.
draft: False

# This is a list of directories that Sweep will not be able to edit.
blocked_dirs: []

# This is a list of documentation links that Sweep will use to help it understand your code. You can add links to documentation for any packages you use here.

# Example:
#
# docs:
#   - PyGitHub: ["https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/", "We use pygithub to interact with the GitHub API"]
